[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/stl3/torgo)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/stl3/torgo)  
---

**torgo** is a command-line program which searches and gathers magnet links of movies, tv shows, anime, porn & documentary videos from a variety of [providers](providers.md).
It then streams the torrent via HTTP (along with its subtitles) and plays it with a user preferred video player (such as *vlc* and *mpv*).
Currently I am only getting this to be in a working state. 

<sub>Note: The original Torrodle repo has been archived since April 2023 and has not been updated in a while, I liked the project (thanks for inspiring me tnychn!) so I just wanted to get it in a working state again.
I have also made modifications so that it deletes the downloads from your `os.TempDir()` or the one you set as `DataDir` in `~/.torgo.json` when quitting the program. Since I am only trying to get it in a working state, options will be added later to toggle keeping/deleting downloads.
I personally do it this way because I have mapped my gpu vram as a disk so that my mechanical drive suffers no wear and tear.

## Usage

For command-line (CLI) usage, see [`CLI.md`](CLI.md).

For API usage, see [`API.md`](API.md).

## Configuration file
Please check [`example.torgo.json`](example.torgo.json)
##### OS PATHS for configuration file
###### Linux
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/torgo/config
###### MacOS
${HOME}/Library/Application Support/torgo/config
###### Termux
$HOME/.config/torgo/config
###### Windows
%APPDATA%\torgo\config

"DataDir": "E:/exampledir",
"ResultsLimit": 150,
"TorrentPort": 56666,
"HostPort": 8080,
"Proxy": "https://example_proxy_address:8008",
"EstablishedConnsPerTorrent": 25,
"HalfOpenConnsPerTorrent": 25,
"TotalHalfOpenConns": 50,
"eztv_cookie": "cookie_value"
"Debug": false
```
Change `DataDir` if you want a custom path for where it downloads files
Change `TorrentPort` to the port you open/forwarded to use with torrents
Change `HostPort` to the port you want to host the file from
Change `Proxy` to whatever proxy you want to use ([anacrolix/torrent](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/anacrolix/torrent?utm_source=godoc#ClientConfig.HTTPProxy) - seems to use this only for fetching metainfo and webtorrent seeds but not for the transport of down/up traffic itself

## Caveeats

In Android, when quitting the player you have to manually stop the server. On Windows this is not an issue.
